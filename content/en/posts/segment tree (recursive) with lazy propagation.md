In [segment tree - iterative](../segment-tree-iterative/) and [segment tree - recursive](../segment-tree-recursive), we know how to use segment tree to query a range sum and update a single element in the array. But if we want to update a range of elements, we will have to call the update function for every index in the range. How can we still do our update in $O(\log{n})$?

By using **lazy propagation**. The idea is to postpone some updates till when we really need(query) them.
